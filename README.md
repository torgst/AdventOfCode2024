# AdventOfCode2024

## How to use (for next year...)

1. Copy the [template.ts](src/template.ts) to a new file.
2. Write code to handle it.
3. Run `npx tsc -w`.
4. Run the task to test, e.g. `node dist/tasks/01-1.js`

## My TMUX setup

1. Run `dev-tmux.sh` from the shell.
2. Run `tmux tsw` to start the typescript compiler in watch mode in a separate pane.
3. The "bind-key" for TMUX is `ctrl+b`. Move between panes using `ctrl+b h/j/k/l`, or `alt+t` from editor to terminal.
